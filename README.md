Billions of trips happen on the planet every day. These trips lead to people meeting each other at home, work or some place else. Friends, family and colleagues use their phones to check where the other has reached, often coordinating when and where to meet. Whether you are a messaging app or a marketplace with messaging capability, your users are likely messaging each other about this. It’s time to solve their problem better.

If your users can track their Uber coming to them turn-by-turn with an accurate ETA, why not track friends, colleagues, buyers and sellers similarly! Facebook Messenger and Google Maps recently added functionality for live location sharing and Whatsapp is likely to follow soon. Now it’s your turn.
