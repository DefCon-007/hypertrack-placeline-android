Placeline is useful in tracking your daily activity. We automagically use the combination of device sensors - GPS, WiFi, network, accelerometer, pedometer, gyroscope, compass - to deliver accurate movement data (location + activity) with near-zero battery usage. Placeline is powered by the HyperTrack SDK which collects location and activity data for your users. It includes segments like stop üõë, walk üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,run üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,drive üèéÔ∏è and cycle üö¥. 

Developers also use Placeline to record & visualize movement of their sales team, delivery & service fleet, and on-ground operations team. It helps them provide visibility when their workforce is out in the field.
